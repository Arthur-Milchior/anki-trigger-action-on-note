This add-on allow you to ensure that some cards have action to some other card. So for example, card 3 would be visible only when card 2 is mature; and card 2 would be suspended when card 3 becomes mature.
All explanations are on https://github.com/Arthur-Milchior/anki-trigger-action-on-note and bug reports should be made here too.
