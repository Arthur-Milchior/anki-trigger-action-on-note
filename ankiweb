This add-on allows you to create actions which cause some cards to affect other cards. For example, unsuspend card 2 only once card 1 becomes mature, and suspend card 1 when card 2 becomes mature.
All explanations are on https://github.com/Arthur-Milchior/anki-trigger-action-on-note and bug reports should be made there too.
